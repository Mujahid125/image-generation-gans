# image-generation-gans
This project uses Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate realistic images from noise. It includes training a generator and discriminator model on a dataset, allowing the system to create new images that closely resemble real ones.


# Image Generation using GANs

This project demonstrates how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used to generate realistic images from random noise. It includes training a generator and discriminator model using a dataset of images.

## 🧠 What are GANs?

GANs consist of two neural networks:
- **Generator**: Creates fake images.
- **Discriminator**: Tries to detect if an image is real or fake.

They compete with each other, and over time, the generator learns to create more realistic images.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for image display)
- Google Colab (optional for training)

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-generation-gans.git
   cd image-generation-gans

pip install -r requirements.txt

python train.py

The model will generate new images that look similar to the training dataset. You can see sample outputs in the results/ folder.
